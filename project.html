		<h1> Giraffes </h1>
		<h3> A tribute to the long-necked, majestic beauty </h3>
		<img src= "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/animalplanetsthemostextreme/images/2/2b/Giraffe.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180620004425"> 
		<p> After millions of years of evolution, the giraffe has developed its defining trait: it's long neck. They are our honored distant relatives, gracing this planet with their beauty. However as Toys R' Us comes to a close, the question arises, are giraffes in danger of becoming extinct? </p>

		<p> This is a photo of the Toys R' Us giraffe taken only 5 years prior from today... </P>

		<p> And yet here that same giraffe stands today- its home a barren wastefield, shelves bare white and empty because of man's cruelty. Giraffes like this one are packing their bags all around the world as Toys R' Us shops close. But it's not only this giraffe, it's giraffes living in plains and forests in Africa. If ignorance to the dwindling numbers of this animal continues, they will soon be extinct. </p>

		<p> To help these wild beasts, you can educate yourselves on how human activity actively causes the number of giraffes to decrease.</p>
