		<p> I've researched around the ol' web, and girrafes are slowly dropping in numbers and have been placed on the endangered species list. This may come as surprising, because giraffes can be spotted in a number of tours around africa and zoos, appearing to be happily munching on leaves. </p>

		<p> But it shouldn't be surprising. Scientists estimate that 10 species go extinct each day. It is time that we cease being ignorant to the suffering of the animal kingdom, starting with the giraffe. Speaking of which, have you ever seen a giraffe asleep? NO BECAUSE YOU ARE IGNORANT. </p>

		<p> Well now you have. IT IS TIME TO STOP BEING IGNORANT. IGNORANCE IS NOT BLISS. LOOK AT THAT SLEEPING GIRAFFE. </p>
